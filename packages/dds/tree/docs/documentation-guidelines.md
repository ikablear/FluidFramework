# Documentation Guidelines

This package uses a mix of markdown and code comments as documentation. In an effort to improve linking and reduce information duplication, the generated API documentation is committed to git. This generated documentation also includes APIs that are not package-public which will not be hosted on the official [Fluid Framework website](fluidframework.com).
