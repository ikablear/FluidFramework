Value that may be stored on a node.

TODO: `Serializable` is not really the right type to use here, since many types (including functions) are "Serializable" (according to the type) despite not being serializable.

Use this type instead of directly using Serializable for both clarity and so the above TODO can be addressed.

This is a named interface instead of a Type alias so tooling (ex: refactors) will not replace it with `any`<!-- -->.
