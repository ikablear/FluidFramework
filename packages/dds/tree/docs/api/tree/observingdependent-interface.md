## Method Details

### listDependees {#listdependees-methodsignature}

Lists the currently subscribed set of Dependees. This is exposed to allow tooling to inspect the dependency graph, and should not be needed for regular functionality. Implementing this is not required: absence of an implementation does not mean there are no dependees.

#### Signature {#listdependees-signature}

```typescript
/** @override */
listDependees(): Iterable<Dependee>;
```

#### Returns {#listdependees-returns}

<b>Return type:</b> Iterable&lt;[Dependee](/docs/apis/tree/dependee-interface)<!-- -->&gt;

### registerDependee {#registerdependee-methodsignature}

Records that dependee has just had this added as a dependent via [Dependee.registerDependent()](/docs/apis/tree/dependee-interface#registerdependent-methodsignature)<!-- -->. Use [recordDependency()](/docs/apis/tree#recorddependency-function) to perform both sides of the recording together.

#### Signature {#registerdependee-signature}

```typescript
registerDependee(dependee: Dependee): void;
```

#### Parameters {#registerdependee-parameters}
