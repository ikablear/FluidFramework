Represents a consecutive run of detached nodes.

Note that in some situations a tombstone is created for the purpose of representing a gap even though no node has been detached. This can happen when a slice-move applied to a gap but not the nodes on both sides of the gap, or when a slice-move is applied to the gap that represents the start (or end) of a field.
