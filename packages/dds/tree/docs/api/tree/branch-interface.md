## Property Details

### isDivergent {#isdivergent-propertysignature}

A branch is divergent iff it has local changes and there is a change outside the branch with a `seqNumber` between the branch's `refSeq` and the `seqNumber` of the last change in the branch. In other words, the ref commit followed by the local changes do not form a contiguous block in the trunk or final sequence.

Note that a commit whose ref number does not match the latest sequence number at the time of its sequencing is not necessarily divergent: if the commit is from the peer who issued the preceding commit, and that preceding commit was not divergent, then the new commit is not divergent either.

More formally, given:

-   A new commit `c`

-   The function `prev(x)` that returns the commit sequenced immediately before commit `x`<!-- -->:

```typescript
isDivergent(c) =
    prev(c) !== undefined &&
    c.refNumber !== prev(c).seqNumber &&
    (prev(c).sessionId !== c.sessionId || isDivergent(prev(c)));
```

#### Signature {#isdivergent-signature}

```typescript
isDivergent: boolean;
```

### localChanges {#localchanges-propertysignature}

#### Signature {#localchanges-signature}

```typescript
localChanges: Commit < TChangeset > [];
```

### refSeq {#refseq-propertysignature}

#### Signature {#refseq-signature}

```typescript
refSeq: SeqNumber;
```
