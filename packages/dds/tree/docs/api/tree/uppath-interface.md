Path from a location in the tree upward. UpPaths can be used with deduplicated upper parts to allow working with paths localized to part of the tree without incurring costs related to the depth of the local subtree.

UpPaths can be thought of as terminating at a special root node (that is `undefined`<!-- -->) who's FieldKeys are all LocalFieldKey's that correspond to detached sequences.

UpPaths can be mutated over time and should be considered to be invalidated when any edits occurs: Use of an UpPath that was acquired before the most recent edit is undefined behavior.

## Signature {#uppath-signature}
